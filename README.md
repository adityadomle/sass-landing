A deliberately minimal SaaS landing engineered as a **foundation**, not a demo.  
Built to favor long-term composability, predictable performance, and low cognitive overhead.

This project treats the landing layer as part of the product surface — not marketing glue.

## ✨ Design Intent

Rather than optimizing for visual density, the system prioritizes:
- Interface restraint over visual noise  
- Composition over hard-coded layout decisions  
- Defaults that scale without rework  

Every section is designed to be replaced, extended, or removed without architectural debt.

---

## 🧩 System Characteristics

- Component boundaries optimized for reuse, not screenshots  
- Mobile-first constraints baked into layout decisions  
- Styling driven by intent, not decoration  
- No implicit coupling between presentation and content  

The goal is to keep iteration cheap as the product evolves.

## 🧱 Stack Rationale

- **Next.js** — Enables server-first rendering and predictable routing  
- **TypeScript** — Forces clarity at the edges of the system  
- **Tailwind CSS** — Reduces abstraction overhead while preserving consistency  
- **shadcn/ui** — Composable primitives over opinionated components  
- **Vercel** — Infrastructure that stays out of the way  

The stack is chosen to minimize friction, not to chase novelty.
